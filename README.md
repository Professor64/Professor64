# Hartin Bruncaj, BS in Biochemistry

I am Hartin Bruncaj, a junior graduating at Binghamton University studying [Biochemistry](https://www.binghamton.edu/biochemistry-and-chemical-biology/undergraduate/index.html)! I use github for side web development projects and python api projects. An example is a static webpage that relies on weather.gov and images to tells you the weather at any location in the United States. Another idea I did was made a sample design page for coding.
*I hope you enjoy the place!*
